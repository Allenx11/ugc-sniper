# ugc-sniper
the best one out there (yet again)

bored to explain how it works on github join my serv instead https://discord.gg/n2xfSuf7p8


## functions
- supports multi ids
- supports multi cookies
- is asynchronous that makes it able to mass buy items
- uses httpx and aiohttp
- supports every device (linux, windows, mac)

## usage
- take a look in config ini (easy explained)
- format of multiple ids:  
- new line for every new id
   
- format of multiple Cookies:
- new line for every new cookie
                           
you don't need multiple ids and cookies one also works
                           
next update 50 stars
